                        <strong>What are you hoping to improve within the world of architecture and construction?</strong>
                        <p>Efficiency - that is a big reason I was drawn to labs and healthcare (and now Pulley!). In lab design, if you can reduce the number of steps between pieces of equipment or make the researchers' processes more efficient, you really play a part in making the world a better place.</p>
                        
                        <strong>What feature in Pulley do you love using the most?</strong>
                        <p>The discussion tool - it keeps all correspondence around a task, comment, document, etc. in one place, for all to see. It provides awesome visibility for people not intimately familiar with the project.</p>
                        
                        <strong>What do you wish more clients would do when using Pulley?</strong>
                        <p>Invite all of their consultants: architects, engineers, contractors. When everyone is on the project in Pulley, outcomes are so much better!</p>

                        <strong>What are you hoping to improve within the world of architecture and construction?</strong>
                        <p>I'm hoping to help push the industry toward more sustainable, efficient, and people-centered outcomes. Buildings and construction are responsible for nearly 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet the processes we use to build them are still among the most inefficient.</p>
                        
                        <strong>What is one common mistake you see made in the permit submittal process?</strong>
                        <p>Missing basic project information on the title sheet!</p>
                        
                        <strong>What is one thing you do that makes a huge difference in your approval outcomes?</strong>
                        <p>Staying consistently engaged with cities—following up, calling, and maintaining momentum. Jurisdictions are often overloaded and understaffed, so simply submitting an application isn't enough.</p>

                        <p>I spent over 9 years working in the architecture and construction space. Before Pulley, I was a project architect for various firms specializing in K-12 schools along the Colorado front range.</p>
                        
                        <strong>Tell us about a memorable project with Pulley:</strong>
                        <p>I got a project approved in Jacksonville, Florida about 90 days ahead of schedule by asking the right questions and emphasizing due diligence. We leveraged Pulley's Expert Network to clarify the requirements we needed since it's a notoriously difficult jurisdiction.</p>
                        
                        <strong>What makes Pulley different from other permitting options to you?</strong>
                        <p>VISIBILITY - I don't know of any other service that provides visibility at all levels of detail from high-level schedule information to each plan review comment.</p>

                        <strong>What first made you interested in the built environment?</strong>
                        <p>I took a basic drafting class early on in middle school and learned how to use AutoCAD. That got me interested in design and architecture. As a kid I was always taking things apart just to see how they worked.</p>
                        
                        <strong>Tell us about a memorable Pulley project you've worked on:</strong>
                        <p>One project really showed how different we are from expeditors or other permit management software. We had a project in Texas where the AHJ required a registered accessibility specialist, but our client didn't have one on their team. Rather than letting that become a roadblock, we tapped into our own network and brought in a local specialist.</p>
                        
                        <strong>What feature on Pulley do you love using the most?</strong>
                        <p>Pulley has direct integrations built into our platform called CitySync, it automatically updates submittal statuses from AHJ portals, which saves so much time and keeps everyone in the loop without needing manual checking.</p>

                        <strong>Tell us about a memorable Pulley project you've worked on:</strong>
                        <p>During a tough plan review, I hit a wall with an examiner who continued flagging issues we already addressed. The project was at risk of major delays, so I reached out to the local city council member's office to facilitate a direct conversation. That step made all the difference.</p>
                        
                        <strong>What is one thing you prioritize that significantly improves permitting outcomes?</strong>
                        <p>Operating nationwide, it's super important to me to make sure teams are always aware of local code adoptions and amendments. Working as an architect in NYC can sometimes feel like you're an archaeologist, digging through layers of zoning text, bulletins, and historical amendments.</p>
                        
                        <strong>What feature on Pulley do you love using the most?</strong>
                        <p>I love the discussion feature! Being able to have in-app conversations about specific submittal items is so helpful for both giving and receiving feedback while tracking decisions.</p>

                        <strong>What is one thing you do that makes a huge difference in your approval outcomes?</strong>
                        <p>I personally call the reviewers and AHJs and speak to them in a polite and friendly manner. When it comes down to it, they are people doing their jobs just like us, and they deserve to be treated as such. Adding the human element and decency to say "thank you" goes a long way.</p>
                        
                        <strong>What is one thing Pulley does better (or differently) from traditional expediting?</strong>
                        <p>It is so much more organized and transparent than traditional expediting services. With Pulley, not only do you have a platform that provides real-time information and tracking, but the Project Managers are absolutely dedicated to getting your permit across the finish line.</p>
                        
                        <strong>Is there a jurisdiction that presented a challenge? How did you tackle it?</strong>
                        <p>I was brought onto a project in Tampa, FL where the building permit had holds that halted issuance. Tampa requires Water and Wastewater Commitment Letters - a 5-6 week process. Pulley got an Early Start Notice from the AHJ so the GC wasn't held up. I called the Water Department weekly until we received approvals 3 weeks ahead of schedule.</p>
